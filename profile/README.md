## Welcome to Studio Denkraum 👋

### Who are we? 🧙
We are an independent game devoplement studio made up of a group of friends. We all met during our time in university and are currently working on our first game project using the [Godot Game Engnine](https://godotengine.org/). 

🍿 You can expect to see our finished game next year !
